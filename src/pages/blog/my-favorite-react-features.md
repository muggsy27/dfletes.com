ReactJS has been my go-to Framework of choice for my last few projects. Here are my favorite features.

## ReactJS

React is a JavaScript library for rendering user interfaces. The main features (in my opinon) are:

* Components
* Conditional Data
* State

```javascript
var a = 'b';

function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```
